# üêº Palmer Penguins Datasets

[https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

The palmerpenguins package contains two datasets:

- One is called `penguins`, and is a simplified version of the raw data
- The second dataset is `penguins_raw`, and contains all the variables and original names as downloaded

Both datasets contain data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to `iris`.
