* ## [Alphafold Protein Database:](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)

  Developed by [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/) and [EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). AlphaFold DB provides open access to over 200 million protein structure predictions to accelerate scientific research by predicting a protein's 3D structure from its amino acid sequence. It regularly achieves accuracy competitive with experiment.

  - The data was collected from 4 databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach.
  - This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
  - In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to date.
  - The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
  - Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

  Diabetes patient records were obtained from two sources:  an automatic electronic recording device and paper records.  
  The automatic device had an internal clock to timestamp events, whereas the paper records only provided "logical time" slots (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime).  
  For paper records, fixed times were assigned to breakfast (08:00), lunch (12:00), dinner (18:00), and bedtime (22:00).  
  Thus paper records have fictitious uniform recording times whereas electronic records have more realistic time stamps.
