  - Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation.
  - A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification.
  - For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera.
  - Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.
